# EarthSimulator

**The original idea of this project is to develop a life-simulation game. We all understand that in our lives, there are many things worth remembering - family, love, work, friendship. Some small moments in life may change our future inadvertently. At the same time, in life, we may experience failures, or achieve some accomplishments, and learn new skills. These will be valuable treasures in our lives. It's a simple truth, "The length of life is hard to control, but the width and height of life are within our grasp." In most cases, we have opportunities to make choices.**

**Most of us may not have unwavering willpower and often give up halfway when doing something that requires persistence, ultimately wasting time and energy without achieving much. The significance of this project lies in addressing this issue. I hope to develop a life-simulation game.**

**In this game, the protagonist is ourselves, and the protagonist's skill tree is our skill tree. We can easily record everything worth remembering in this game. This way, our personal growth is manifested in the game, and when we see the skill tree in the game growing and flourishing, it's like witnessing our life journey.**
