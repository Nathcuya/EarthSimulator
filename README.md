# EarthSimulator

**The original idea of this project is to develop a life-simulation game. We all understand that in our lives, there are many things worth remembering - family, love, work, friendship. Some small moments in life may change our future inadvertently. At the same time, in life, we may experience failures, or achieve some accomplishments, and learn new skills. These will be valuable treasures in our lives. It's a simple truth, "The length of life is hard to control, but the width and height of life are within our grasp." In most cases, we have opportunities to make choices.**
